For each TPG you wish to train with the Trainer target, create a subdirectory with 
* **instructions.cpp** with the instructions you want to add to the instruction set (see gegelati-apps/pendulum for the template of the file)
* **params.json** with the parameters for the training

Trainings results will then be geneated in a Result subfolder.
